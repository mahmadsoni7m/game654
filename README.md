# Cyber Void: Survivor — Android

This repository contains the original 2D canvas arena-survivor game. It is not the Battle Royale prototype.

## Build an Android APK with GitHub Actions

1. Upload the contents of this ZIP to the root of a GitHub repository.
2. Push to `main` (or `master`), or open **Actions** and run **Build Cyber Void Survivor APK**.
3. When the workflow succeeds, open the run and download the `Cyber-Void-Survivor-APK` artifact.
4. Extract `app-debug.apk` and install it on an Android device.

## Local web development

Requires Node.js 22.

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

## Android build details

- Capacitor 7 generates the Android project during the workflow.
- Capacitor configuration is JSON to avoid TypeScript config-loader incompatibilities.
- Vite uses relative asset paths (`base: './'`) for Android WebView.
- Android is configured for landscape orientation and immersive full-screen mode.
- The workflow produces a debug APK. A signed release APK requires a signing keystore.
